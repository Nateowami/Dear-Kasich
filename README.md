# An open letter to Governor Kasich

Code for website live at [DearKasich.com](https://dearkasich.com).

Built with Node.js, Express, Mongo, Materialize, and jQuery.

# Archived

With the purpose of the website no longer existent, it doesn't make sense to leave it up and active. As such, I've posted an archive of the website, as it appeared on June 11, 2016, for posterity. You'll find it on [the releases page](https://github.com/Nateowami/Dear-Kasich/releases).

The website has gone read-only and will eventually be taken down.

# TODO

* Tidy layout of the modal dialog shown after successful signing
* Make sure it's solid. Need to work on QA.
* Code needs cleanup. Goes right along with QA.
